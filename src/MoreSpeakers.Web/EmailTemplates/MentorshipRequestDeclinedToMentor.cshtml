<p>Hey @Model.Mentee.FullName, </p>

<p>We wanted to let you know that the mentorship with @Model.Mentee.FullName has been declined by yourself. We know it was a hard decision and we hope that you find a fulfilling mentoring connection soon with another new speaker in the MoreSpeakers.com community. </p>

<p>Thank you again for being a part of the MoreSpeakers community and if you have any questions please contact Chris Woody Woodruff at [cwoodruff@live.com](mailto:cwoodruff@live.com)  or Joe Guadagno at [jguadagno@hotmail.com](mailto:jguadagno@hotmail.com) </p>
